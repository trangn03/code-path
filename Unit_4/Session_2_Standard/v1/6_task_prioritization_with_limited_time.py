""" 
You often have a long list of tasks to complete, but limited time to do so. Each task has a specific duration, and you only have a certain amount of time available in your schedule. You need to prioritize and complete as many tasks as possible within the given time limit.

Given a list of task durations and a time limit, determine the maximum number of tasks you can complete within that time.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
