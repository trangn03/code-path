"""
You're curating a large collection of NFTs for a digital art gallery, and your first task is to extract the names of these NFTs from a given list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list represents an NFT, and contains information such as the name, creator, and current value.

Write the extract_nft_names() function, which takes in this list and returns a list of all NFT names.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
