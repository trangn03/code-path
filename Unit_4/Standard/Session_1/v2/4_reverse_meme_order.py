You want to see how memes would trend if they were posted in reverse order.

Write the reverse_memes() function, which takes a list of memes (representing the order they were posted) and returns a new list with the memes in reverse order.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
