You have been tasked with identifying the most popular NFT creators in your collection. A creator is considered "popular" if they have created more than one NFT in the collection.

Write the identify_popular_creators() function, which takes a list of NFTs and returns a list of the names of popular creators.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
