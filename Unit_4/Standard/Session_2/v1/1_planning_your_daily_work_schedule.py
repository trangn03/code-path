""" 
Your day consists of various tasks, each requiring a certain amount of time. To optimize your workday, you want to find a pair of tasks that fits exactly into a specific time slot you have available. You need to identify if there is a pair of tasks whose combined time matches the available slot.

Given a list of integers representing the time required for each task and an integer representing the available time slot, write a function that returns True if there exists a pair of tasks that exactly matches the available time slot, and False otherwise.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
