"""
You are given an array of strings performer_names, and an array performance_times that consists of distinct positive integers representing the performance durations in minutes. 
Both arrays are of length n.
For each index i, performer_names[i] and performance_times[i] denote the name and performance duration of the ith performer.
Return performer_names sorted in descending order by the performance durations.
