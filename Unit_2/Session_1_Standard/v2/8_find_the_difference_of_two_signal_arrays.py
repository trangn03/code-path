"""
You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays signals1 and signals2, representing signal data from two different probes. Return a list answer of size 2 where:
answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in signals1 which are not present in signals2.
answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in signals2 which are not present in signals1.
Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.
Below is the pseudocode for the problem. Implement this in Python and explain your implementation step-by-step. 
1. Convert signals1 and signals2 to sets.
2. Find the difference between set1 and set2 and store it in diff1.
3. Find the difference between set2 and set1 and store it in diff2.
4. Return the list [diff1, diff2].

# Example Usage:

signals1_example1 = [1, 2, 3]
signals2_example1 = [2, 4, 6]

signals1_example2 = [1, 2, 3, 3]
signals2_example2 = [1, 1, 2, 2]

print(find_difference(signals1_example1, signals2_example1)) 
print(find_difference(signals1_example2, signals2_example2))
# Example Output:

# [[1, 3], [4, 6]]
# [[3], []]
