""" 
You are given a string ecosystem_data that consists of digits and lowercase English letters. 
The digits represent the observed counts of various species in a protected ecosystem.
You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, "f123de34g8hi34" will become " 123 34 8 34". 
Notice that you are left with some species counts that are separated by at least one space: "123", "34", "8", and "34".
Return the number of unique species counts after performing the replacement operations on ecosystem_data.
Two species counts are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.
