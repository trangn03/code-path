"""
As a seasoned traveler, you've collected a variety of souvenirs from different destinations. 
You have an array of string souvenirs, where each string represents a type of souvenir. 
You want to know if the number of occurrences of each type of souvenir in your collection is unique.
Write a function that takes in an array souvenirs and returns True if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique, or False otherwise.

# Example Usage:

souvenirs1 = ["keychain", "hat", "hat", "keychain", "keychain", "postcard"]
souvenirs2 = ["postcard", "postcard", "postcard", "postcard"]
souvenirs3 = ["keychain", "magnet", "hat", "candy", "postcard", "stuffed bear"]

print(unique_souvenir_counts(souvenirs1))  
print(unique_souvenir_counts(souvenirs2)) 
print(unique_souvenir_counts(souvenirs3))

"""
Example Output:

True
Example 1 Explanation: The value "keychain" has 3 occurrences, "hat" has 2 
and "postcard" has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

True
Example 2 Explanation: The value "postcard" appears 4 times There's only one count (4), which is technically unique, so this should also return True.

False
Example 3 Explanation: Each item appears 1 time All counts are 1, which is not unique, so this should return False.
