Given two lists of tourist attractions, tourist_list1 and tourist_list2, find the common attractions with the least total travel time.

A common attraction is one that appears in both tourist_list1 and tourist_list2.

A common attraction with the least total travel time is a common attraction such that if it appeared at tourist_list1[i] and tourist_list2[j] then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common attractions.

Return all the common attractions with the least total travel time. Return the answer in any order.
