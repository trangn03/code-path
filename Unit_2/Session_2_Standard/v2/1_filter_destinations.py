You're planning an epic trip and have a dictionary of destinations mapped to their respective rating scores. 
Your goal is to visit only the best-rated destinations. 
Write a function that takes in a dictionary destinations and a rating_threshold as parameters. 
The function should iterate through the dictionary and remove all destinations that have a rating strictly below the rating_threshold. Return the updated dictionary.
