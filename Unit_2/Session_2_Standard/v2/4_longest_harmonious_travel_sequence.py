"""
In a list of travel packages, we define a harmonious travel sequence as a sequence where the difference between the maximum and minimum travel ratings is exactly 1.
Given an integer array rating, return the length of the longest harmonious travel sequence among all its possible subsequences.
A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
You are provided with a partially implemented solution that contains bugs. Your task is to identify and fix the bugs to ensure the solution works correctly.
