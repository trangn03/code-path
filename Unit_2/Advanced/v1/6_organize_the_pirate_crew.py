"""
Captain Blackbeard needs to organize his pirate crew into different groups for a treasure hunt. Each pirate has a unique ID from 0 to n - 1.

You are given an integer array group_sizes, where group_sizes[i] is the size of the group that pirate i should be in. For example, if group_sizes[1] = 3, then pirate 1 must be in a group of size 3.

Return a list of groups such that each pirate i is in a group of size group_sizes[i].

Each pirate should appear in exactly one group, and every pirate must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.

# Example Usage:

group_sizes1 = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3]
group_sizes2 = [2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2]

print(organize_pirate_crew(group_sizes1))

Example Output:
