"""
Captain Blackbeard has a treasure map with several clues that point to different locations on an island. 
Each clue is associated with a specific location and the number of treasures buried there. Given a dictionary treasure_map where keys are location names and values are integers representing the number of treasures buried at those locations, 
write a function total_treasures() that returns the total number of treasures buried on the island.
