"""
Captain Dread is keeping track of the crew's activities using a log. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [pirateID, time] indicates that the pirate with pirateID performed an action at the minute time.

Multiple pirates can perform actions simultaneously, and a single pirate can perform multiple actions in the same minute.

The pirate action minutes (PAM) for a given pirate is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the pirate performed an action. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that, for each j (1 <= j <= k), answer[j] is the number of pirates whose PAM equals j.

Return the array answer as described above.
