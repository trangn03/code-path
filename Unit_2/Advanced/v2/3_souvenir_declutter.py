"""
As a time traveler, you've collected a mountain of souvenirs over the course of your travels. You're running out of room to store them all and need to declutter. Given a list of strings souvenirs and a integer threshold, declutter your souvenirs by writing a function declutter() that returns a list of souvenirs strictly below threshold.
"""
def declutter(souvenirs, threshold):
    pass

# Example Usage:
souvenirs1 = ["coin", "alien egg", "coin", "coin", "map", "map", "statue"]
threshold1 = 3

souvenirs2 = ["postcard", "postcard", "postcard", "sword"]
threshold = 2

"""
Example Output:

["alien egg", "map", "map", "statue"]
["sword"]
