"""
As a time traveler, you have recorded the occurrences of specific events at different time points. You suspect that some events might be occurring too frequently within short time spans, indicating potential temporal anomalies. Given an array time_points where each element represents an event ID at a particular time point, and an integer k, determine if there are two distinct time points i and j such that time_points[i] == time_points[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Note: The indices must be unique, but not the values i and j themselves.
