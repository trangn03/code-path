"""
In the ancient Library of Alexandria, a temporal rift has scattered several important scrolls across different rooms. You are given a dictionary library_catalog that maps room names to the number of scrolls that room should have and a second dictionary actual_distribution that maps room names to the number of scrolls found in that room after the temporal rift.

Write a function analyze_library() that determines if any room has more or fewer scrolls than it should. The function should return a dictionary where the keys are the room names and the values are the differences in the number of scrolls (actual number of scrolls - expected number of scrolls). You must loop over the dictionaries to compute the differences.
