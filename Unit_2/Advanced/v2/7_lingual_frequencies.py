"""
As a time traveling linguist, you are analyzing texts written in an ancient script. However, some words in the text are illegible and can't be deciphered. Write a function find_most_frequent_word() that accepts a string text and a list of illegible words illegibles and returns the most frequent word in text that is not an illegible word.
"""
def find_most_frequent_word(text, illegibles):
    pass
    
# Example Usage:
paragraph1 = "a."
illegibles1 = []
print(find_most_frequent_word(paragraph1, illegibles1)) 

paragraph2 = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
illegibles2 = ["hit"]
print(find_most_frequent_word(paragraph2, illegibles2)) 

"""
Example Output:

a

ball
Example 2 Explanation:
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is an unknown word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent legible word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is illegible."""
