"""
In an effort to understand species diversity in different habitats, researchers are analyzing species pairs observed in various regions. 
Each pair is represented by a list [a, b] where a and b represent two species observed together.
A species pair [a, b] is considered equivalent to another pair [c, d] if and only if either (a == c and b == d) or (a == d and b == c). 
This means that the order of species in a pair does not matter.
Your task is to determine the number of equivalent species pairs in the list of observed species pairs.
