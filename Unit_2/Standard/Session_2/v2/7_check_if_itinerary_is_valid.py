""" 
You are given an itinerary itinerary representing a list of trips between cities, where each city is represented by an integer. We consider an itinerary valid if it is a permutation of an itinerary template base[n].

The template base[n] is defined as [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] (in other words, it is an itinerary of length n + 1 that visits cities 1 to n - 1 exactly once, plus visits city n twice). For example, base[1] = [1, 1] and base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].

Return True if the given itinerary is valid, otherwise return False.

A permutation is an arrangement of a set of elements. For example [3, 2, 1] and [2, 3, 1] are both possible permutations of the set of numbers 1, 2, and 3.

# Example Usage:

itinerary1 = [2, 1, 3]
itinerary2 = [1, 3, 3, 2]
itinerary3 = [1, 1]

print(is_valid_itinerary(itinerary1))
print(is_valid_itinerary(itinerary2))

Example Output:

False
Example 1 Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, 
the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], 
is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array itinerary1 has three. 
Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].
So the answer is false.

True
Example 2 Explanation:  Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only 
candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It 
can be seen that itinerary2 is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] 
(by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). 
Therefore, the answer is true.

True
Example 3 Explanation; Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only 
candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It 
can be seen that itinerary3 is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. 
Therefore, the answer is true.
