Oh no! You're flight has been cancelled and you need to rebook. Given an adjacency matrix of today's flights flights where each flight is labeled 0 to n-1 and flights[i][j] = 1 indicates that there is an available flight from location i to location j, return True if there exists a path from your current location source to your final destination dest. Otherwise return False.

Evaluate the time complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.
