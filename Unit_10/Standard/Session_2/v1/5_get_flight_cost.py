""" 
You are given an adjacency dictionary flights where for any location source, flights[source] is a list of tuples in the form (destination, cost) indicating that there exists a flight from source to destination at ticket price cost.

Given a starting location start and a final destination dest return the total cost of flying from start to dest. If it is not possible to fly from start to dest, return -1. If there are multiple possible paths from start to dest, return any of the possible answers.

Example Output:

550
Explanation: There is a path from LAX -> SFO -> ORD -> MIA with ticket prices 50 + 100 + 400 = 550
960 would also be an acceptable answer following the path from LAX -> SFO -> ERW -> ORD -> MIA
