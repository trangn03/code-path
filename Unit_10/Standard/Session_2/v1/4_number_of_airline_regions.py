CodePath Airlines operates in different regions around the world. Some airports are connected directly with flights, while others are not. However, if airport a is connected directly to airport b, and airport b is connected directly to airport c, then airport a is indirectly connected to airport c.

An airline region is a group of directly or indirectly connected airports and no other airports outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix is_connected where is_connected[i][j] = 1 if CodePath Airlines offers a direct flight between airport i and airport j, and is_connected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of airline regions operated by CodePath Airlines.
