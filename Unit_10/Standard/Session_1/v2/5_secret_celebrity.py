""" 
A new reality show is airing in which a famous celebrity pretends to be a non-famous person. As contestants get to know each other, they have to guess who the celebrity among them is to win the show. An even bigger twist: there might be no celebrity at all! The show has n contestants labeled from 1 to n.

If the celebrity exists, then:

The celebrity trusts none of the contestants.
Due to the celebrity's charisma, all the contestants trust the celebrity.
There is exactly one person who satisfies rules 1 and 2.
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [a, b] indicates that contestant a trusts contestant b. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return the label of the celebrity if they exist and can be identified. Otherwise, return -1.
