""" 
You are organizing the seating arrangement for a big awards ceremony and want to make a copy for your assistant. The seating arrangement is stored in a graph where each Node value val is the name of a celebrity guest at the ceremony and its array neighbors are all the guests sitting in seats adjacent to the celebrity.

Given a reference to a Node in the original seating arrangement seat, make a deep copy (clone) of the seating arrangement. Return the copy of the given node.

We have provided a function compare_graphs() to help with testing this function. To use this function, pass in the given node seat and the copy of that node your function copy_seating() returns. If the two graphs are clones of each other, the function will return True. Otherwise, the function will return False.
