As a flight coordinator for CodePath airlines, you have a 0-indexed adjacency list flights with n nodes where each node represents the ID of a different destination and flights[i] is an integer array indicating that there is a flight from destination i to each destination in flights[i]. Write a function bidirectional_flights() that returns True if for any flight from a destination i to a destination j there also exists a flight from destination j to destination i. Return False otherwise.
