""" 
You are a travel coordinator for CodePath Airlines, and you're helping a customer find all possible destinations they can reach from a starting airport. The flight connections between airports are represented as an adjacency dictionary flights, where each key is a destination, and the corresponding value is a list of other destinations that are reachable through a direct flight.

Given a starting location start, write a function get_all_destinations() that uses Depth First Search (DFS) to return a list of all destinations that can be reached from start. The list should include both direct and connecting flights and should be ordered based on the order in which airports are visited in DFS.
