The superhero team, The Fantastic Four, are training to increase their power levels. Their power level is represented as a power of 4. Write a recursive function that calculates the power of 4 raised to the nth power to determine their training level.

Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.
