""" 
In Wakanda, vibranium is the most precious resource, and it is found in several deposits. Each deposit is represented by a character in a string (e.g., "V" for vibranium, "G" for gold, etc.)

Given a string resources, write a recursive function count_deposits() that returns the total number of distinct vibranium deposits in resources.

Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.
"""

def count_deposits(resources):
    pass

# Example Usage:

print(count_deposits("VVVVV"))
print(count_deposits("VXVYGA"))

"""
Example Output:

5
2
Example 2 Explanation: There are two characters "V" in the string "VXVYGA", 
therefore there are two vibranium deposits in the string.
