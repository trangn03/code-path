""" 
Some of Iron Man's suits are duplicates. Given a list of strings suits where each string is a suit in Stark's collection, count the total number of unique suits in the list.

Implement the solution iteratively.
Implement the solution recursively.
Discuss: what are the similarities between the two solutions? What are the differences?
Evaluate the time complexity of each solution. Are they the same? Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.
