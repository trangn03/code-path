In the kingdom's grand tournament, knights compete in a series of challenges. A knight's performance in the challenge is represented by a string challenges, where a success is represented by an S and each other outcome (like a draw or loss) is represented by an "O". Write a recursive function to find the length of the longest consecutive streak of successful challenges ("S").

Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.
