"""
The court magician is practicing a spell that doubles its power with each incantation. Given an integer initial_power and a non-negative integer n, write a recursive function that doubles initial_power n times.

Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.

def double_power(initial_power, n):
    pass

# Example Usage:

print(double_power(5, 3))
print(double_power(7, 2))

"""
Example Output

40
Example 1 Explanation: 5 doubled 3 times: 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 40

Output: 28
Example 2 Explanation: 7 doubled 2 times: 7 -> 14 -> 28
