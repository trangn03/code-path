A knight is traveling along a path marked by stones, and each stone has a number on it. The knight must check if the numbers on the stones form a strictly increasing sequence. Write a recursive function to determine if the sequence is strictly increasing.

Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.
