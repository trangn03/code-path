""" 
In a faraway kingdom, a castle is surrounded by multiple defensive walls, where each wall is nested within another. Given a list of lists walls where each list [] represents a wall, write a recursive function count_walls() that returns the total number of walls.

Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.
