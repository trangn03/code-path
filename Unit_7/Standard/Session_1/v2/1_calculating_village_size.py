""" 
In the kingdom of Codepathia, the queen determines how many resources to distribute to a village based on its class. A village's class is equal to the number of digits in its population. Given an integer population, write a function get_village_class() that returns the number of digits in population.

Implement the solution iteratively.
Implement the solution recursively.
Discuss: what are the similarities between the two solutions? What are the differences?
