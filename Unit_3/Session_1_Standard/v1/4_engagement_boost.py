""" 
You track your daily engagement rates as a list of integers, sorted in non-decreasing order. To analyze the impact of certain strategies, you decide to square each engagement rate and then sort the results in non-decreasing order.

Given an integer array engagements sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Your Task:

Read through the existing solution and add comments so that everyone in your pod understands how it works.
Modify the solution below to use the two-pointer technique.
