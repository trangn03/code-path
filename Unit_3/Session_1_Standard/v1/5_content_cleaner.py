""" 
You want to make sure your posts are clean and professional. Given a string post of lowercase and uppercase English letters, you want to remove any pairs of adjacent characters where one is the lowercase version of a letter and the other is the uppercase version of the same letter. Keep removing such pairs until the post is clean.

A clean post does not have two adjacent characters post[i] and post[i + 1] where:

post[i] is a lowercase letter and post[i + 1] is the same letter in uppercase or vice-versa.
Return the clean post.

Note that an empty string is also considered clean.
