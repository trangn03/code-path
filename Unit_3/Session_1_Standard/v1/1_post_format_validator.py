""" 
You are managing a social media platform and need to ensure that posts are properly formatted. Each post must have balanced and correctly nested tags, such as () for mentions, [] for hashtags, and {} for links. You are given a string representing a post's content, and your task is to determine if the tags in the post are correctly formatted.

A post is considered valid if:

Every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag of the same type.
Tags are closed in the correct order.
