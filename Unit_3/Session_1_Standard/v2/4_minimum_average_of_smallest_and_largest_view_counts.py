You manage a collection of view counts for different shows on a streaming platform. You are given an array view_counts of n integers, where n is even.

You repeat the following procedure n / 2 times:

Remove the show with the smallest view count, min_view_count, and the show with the largest view count, max_view_count, from view_counts.
Add (min_view_count + max_view_count) / 2 to the list of average view counts average_views.
Return the minimum element in average_views.
