"""
Given an array nums with n integers, write a function non_decreasing() that checks if nums could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).

# Example Usage:
nums = [4, 2, 3]
non_decreasing(nums)

nums = [4, 2, 1]
non_decreasing(nums)

Example Output:
