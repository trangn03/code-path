"""
The Riddler is planning to leave a coded message to lead Batman into a trap. Write a function shuffle() that takes in a string, the Riddler's message, and encodes it using an integer array indices. The message will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position in message moves to index indices[i] in the shuffled string. You may assume len(message) is equal to the len(indices).

# Example Usage:
message = "evil"
indices = [3, 1, 2, 0]
shuffle(message, indices)

message = "findme"
indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
shuffle(message, indices)

Example Output:
