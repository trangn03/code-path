"""
Write a function running_sum() that accepts a list of integers superhero_stats representing the number of crimes Batman has stopped each month in Gotham City. 
The function should modify the list to return the running sum such that superhero_stats[i] = sum(superhero_stats[0]...superhero_stats[i]). 
You must modify the list in place;  you may not create any new lists as part of your solution.
