If you solved max_tiers() in the previous problem using a depth first search approach, reimplement your solution using a breadth first search approach. If you implemented it using a breadth first search approach, use a depth first search approach.

Evaluate the time complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time complexity.
