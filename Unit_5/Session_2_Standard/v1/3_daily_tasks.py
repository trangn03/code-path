Imagine a linked list used as a daily task list where each node represents a task. Write a function add_task() that takes in the head of a linked list and adds a new node to the front of the task list.

The function should insert a new Node object with the value task as the new head of the linked list and return the new node.

Note: The "head" of a linked list is the first element in the linked list. It is equivalent to lst[0] of a normal list.
