""" 
In the Player class below, each player has a race_outcomes attribute which holds a list of integers describing what place they came in for each race in a tournament.

Write a method get_tournament_place() that takes in one parameter, opponents, a list of other player objects also participating in the tournament, and returns the place in the overall tournament.

Rank in the tournament is determined by the lowest average race outcome. (1st place is better than 2nd!)
Each opponent in opponents is guaranteed to have participated in the same number of races as the current player.
