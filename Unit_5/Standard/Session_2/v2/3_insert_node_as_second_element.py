Write a function add_second() that takes in the head of a linked list and a value val as parameters. It should insert val as the second node in the linked list and return the head of the linked list. (You can assume head is not None.)

Note: The "head" of a linked list is the first element in the linked list. It is equivalent to lst[0] of a normal list.
