""" 
A linked list is a data structure that, similar to a normal list or array, allows us to store pieces of data sequentially. The key difference is how the elements are stored in memory.

In a normal list, elements are stored in adjacent memory locations. If we know the location of the first element, we can easily access any other element in the list.

In a linked list, individual elements, called nodes, are not stored in sequential memory locations. Instead, each node stores a reference or pointer to the next node in the list, allowing us to traverse the list.

Connect the provided node instances below to create the linked list kk_slider -> harriet -> saharah -> isabelle.

A function print_linked_list() which accepts the head, or first element, of a linked list and prints the values of the list has also been provided for testing purposes.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):

        self.next = next

# For testing

# Add code here to link the above nodes
