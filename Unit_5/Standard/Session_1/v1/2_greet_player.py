""" 
Step 1: Using the Villager class from Problem 1, add the following greet_player() method to your existing code:
def greet_player(self, player_name):
    return f"{self.name}: Hey there, {player_name}! How's it going, {self.catchphrase}!"

Step 2: Create a second instance of Villager in a variable named bones.
The Villager object created should have name "Bones", species "Dog", and catchphrase "yip yip".

Step 3: Call the method greet_player() with your name and print out "Bones: Hey there, <your name>! How's it going, yip yip!". For example, if your name is Tram, "Bones: Hey there, Tram! How's it going, yip yip?" would be printed out to the console.
