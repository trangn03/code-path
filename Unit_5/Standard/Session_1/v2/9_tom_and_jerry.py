"""
A linked list is a new data type that, similar to a normal list or array, allows us to store pieces of data sequentially. The difference between a linked list and a normal list lies in how each element is stored in a computer’s memory.

In a normal list, individual elements of the list are stored in adjacent memory locations according to the order they appear in the list. If we know where the first element of the list is stored, it’s really easy to find any other element in the list.

In a linked list, the individual elements called nodes are not stored in sequential memory locations. Each node may be stored in an unrelated memory location. To connect nodes together into a sequential list, each node stores a reference or pointer to the next node in the list.

Using the provided Node class below, create a linked list cat -> mouse where the instance cat has value "Tom" which points to the instance mouse that has value "Jerry". 
"""

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next
# Example Usage:

print(cat.value)
print(cat.next)
print(cat.next.value)
print(mouse.value)
print(mouse.next)

"""
Example Output:

Tom
mouse
Jerry
Jerry
None
