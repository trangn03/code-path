"""
Players can pick up special items as they race.

Update the Player class with a new method add_item() that takes in one parameter, item_name.

The method should validate the item_name.

If the item is valid, add item_name to the playerâ€™s items attribute.
The method does not need to return any values.
item_name is valid if it has one of the following values: "banana", "green shell", "red shell", "bob-omb", "super star", "lightning", "bullet bill".
