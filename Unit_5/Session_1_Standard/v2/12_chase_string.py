""" 
Write a function chase_list() that takes in the head of a linked list and returns a string linking together the values of the list with the separator "chases".

Note: The "head" of a linked list is the first element in the linked list, equivalent to lst[0] of a normal list.
"""
# Example Usage:

dog = Node("Spike")
cat = Node("Tom")
mouse = Node("Jerry")
cheese = Node("Gouda")

dog.next = cat
cat.next = mouse
mouse.next = cheese

print(chase_list(dog))

# Example Output: "Spike chases Tom chases Jerry chases Gouda"
