""" 
The Villager constructor has been updated to include an additional attribute neighbor. 
A villager's neighbor is another Villager instance and represents their closest neighbor. 
By default, a Villager's neighbor is set to None.

Given two Villager instances start_villager and target_villager, 
write a function message_received() that returns True if you can pass a message from the start_villager to the target_villager through a series of neighbors and False otherwise.

Example Output:

True
Example 1 Explanation: Isabelle can pass a message to her neighbor, Tom Nook. Tom Nook can then pass the 
message to his neighbor, KK Slider. KK Slider is the target, therefore the function should return True.


False
Example 2 Explanation: KK Slider doesn't have a neighbor, so you cannot pass a message to Isabelle from KK Slider.
