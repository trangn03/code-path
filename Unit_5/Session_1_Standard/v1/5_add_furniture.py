""" 
Players and villagers in Animal Crossing can add furniture to their inventory to decorate their house.

Update the Villager class with a new method add_item() that takes in one parameter, item_name.

The method should validate the item_name.

If the item is valid, add item_name to the player’s furniture attribute.
The method does not need to return any values.
item_name is valid if it has one of the following values: "acoustic guitar", "ironwood kitchenette", "rattan armchair", "kotatsu", or "cacao tree".
