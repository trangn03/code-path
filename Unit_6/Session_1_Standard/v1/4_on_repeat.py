A variation of the two-pointer technique introduced in previous units is to have a slow and a fast pointer that increment at different rates.

We would like to check whether our playlist loops or not. Given the head of a linked list playlist_head, return True if the playlist has a cycle in it and False otherwise. A linked list has a cycle if at some point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points back to a previous node in the list.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
