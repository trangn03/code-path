Given the head of a linked list playlist_head that may contain a cycle, use the fast and slow pointer method to return the length of the cycle. If the list does not contain a cycle, return 0.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
