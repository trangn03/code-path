""" 
In a nearby enchanted forest, magical paths sometimes loop back on themselves, creating never-ending cycles. Write a function loop_start() to help you keep your way. The function accepts the head of a linked list path_start and returns the value of the node where the cycle starts. If the path has no cycle, return None.

A linked list has a cycle if, at some point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points back to a previous node in the list.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
