"""
All the clues that lead us in circles are false evidence we need to purge! Given the head of a linked list evidence, clean up the evidence list by identifying any false clues. Write a function collect_false_evidence() that returns an array containing all values that are part of any cycle in evidence. Return the values in any order.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
